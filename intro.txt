History of javaScript (JS)
1995 -> created by brendan eich at netscape in just 10 days.
Originally called mocha, then LiveScript, finally renamed Java Script ( even though its not related to java)\
Designed to add interactively to web pages.
Standardized under ECMAScript (first standard in 1997)
Grew over time from small scripts -> full web apps -> backend (node.js) -> desktop & mobile apps.

What is Java Script?
JavaScript is a high - level, interpreted, mu;ti-paradigm programming language.
It runs mainly in the browser but also on servers (Node.js)
It's dynamic (types can change), event-driven, and supports object-oriented, functional, and imperative styles.
Often paired with HTML + CSS to build web apps.

Why JavaScript?
Browser-native  -> runs directly in all modern browser.
Versatile -> frontend (react, vue), backend (Node.js), mobile (react Native), desktop (electron),IOT, and even AI/ML
Massive ecosystem -> libraries, frameworks, NPM packages
Active community -> Tons of tools, tutorials, and updates.
Asynchronous -> Handles events, promises, API's smoothly.

Use Cases of JavaScript
1. Building interactive websites ( animations, form validation, dynamic content)
2. Developing single-page applications (SPAs) (React, Angular,Vue)
3. Creating mobile apps ( React Native,Ionic)
4. Writing backend services (Node.js + Express)
5. Making desktop apps (Electron, Tauri)
6. Building browser extensions
7. Working with real-time apps (chats, live updates, WebSockets)
8. Even game development,IOT projects, and machine learning experiments.
